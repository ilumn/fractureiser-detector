# fractureiser-detector
#### Detects the malware embeded in recent comrpomised CurseForge mods (currently reffered to as fractureiser)
----
For easy of use or run preference I have included Java, Python, and Javascript versions of the detector. I recommend Python but it is up to you.
to run the python script use the following command:
```py3 fractureiser-detector.py``` (windows)
or
```python3 fractureiser-detector.py``` (linux)
followed by the absolute file path to the jar when you are prompted.
